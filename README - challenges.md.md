1. I would say I ran into challenge initiall with precedence. I was having some trouble with a button working and realized that I needed to move a few things around.

2. I also struggled by making the mistake of looking at the design first, and getting to work wthout looking at some of the specific requirements first. If I had looked at the requirements beforehand I may not have had to make changes after the code was working.

3. I ran into some challenges with the media queries but was able to fix them but playing with different setting till I found what worked best for our project.
