HOMEWORK 1

Below are the resources I used if I ever pulled information from outside the resources provided:

https://github.com/git-guides/git-pull
-I used this to learn how I take a local branch and update that with information that is currently 
on a branch on the remote repositiory. 
-I read all sections up to the section "keep the master up to date"

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Undoing-Things
-I used this resource to learn how to unstage multiple files as well as a single file that had been staged
-I read the first 2 sections "undoing things" and "unstaging a staged file"
