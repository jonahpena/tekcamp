- I watched all the content from net ninja and worked through his tutorial, I also walked through it and attempted to implement the concepts into my own code. I thought I got very close, where I was able to log comments (under the "title" prop) into an object, and was ALMOST able to store that into a Json server. I realize that wasn't even the assignment but it seemed like it was getting me closer to the goal of loading in the dummy api's.
- his tutorial DID successfully help me with my routing. This seemed like an easy concept, really it was the data mapping I am struggling with and plan to work on more tonight to prep for my capstone.

- I have only worked through this briefly but I plan to work through this all and figure I may as well drop it here.

- These videos did not make their way into my code but I did watch them 

6. I spent the first few days rewatching the webex recording to see abigail implement her dummy api. I attempted to implement her code (can befound in "unusedAPIComponents" folder) but wasn't able to successfully map her data to my components.
