HOMEWORK 6

EX 1. Was able to figure this out after going over java basics with Mosh, many concepts listed here but I actually bought a course with Mosh since I really liked him. His fundamentals course is what help me with exercise 1, and I then refactored this code into OOP with help from his Part 2 course which I believe can only be found in the link below. I wasn't able to COMPLETELY refactor to OOP on my own, I hopped in help and recieved help from Beth, Kit, Kuryn, and Cole to finish exercise 1. (may have been a few others too)

EX 2. Beth walked me through this exercise in the same fashion Abram does. She lead in in the right direction by asking my questions on what I would do and how I would do it. When I was incorrect she'd let me guess then explain why.
-Mosh's advanced Java course (part 3) is what helped me grasp concepts like HashMaps and Lists, as well as some great videos on youtube I went through. I'll drop the videos but Mosh's "Collections" section in his Advanced Java course pt. 3 is where I grasped the majority of the concepts. However, putting the concepts together to solve the problem wasn't something I managed to do on my own.

EX 3. Abram walked us through this exercise in office hours on a late Friday night. shoutout abram for staying till 8 on a friday night!

EX 4. Abram walked us through this one on friday night too and I used that to help with getting started, but wasn't able to piece everything together until our group had a huddle on Sunday. Beth was able to walk me and a few other students through the exercise, but in Abram fashion we were all able to grasp the majority of concepts.

EX 5. I very much tried to complete this one solo. I did reach out to a friend outside the camp and he gave me some pointers that helped me get as far as I did. However I wasn't able to complete the exercise. Given more time, I belive I would have made abit more progress on the "expressionParser" class and would have felt more comfortable going to office hours for help.

TESTING

EX 1. Was able to figure this first one out by using the lecture slides.

EX 2. Had this very close to working on my own but my problem was the actual value would not match up with the hashmap type displayed. Kit put me on a path to success just by pointing out that I would need to bring the hashmap into my test and I was able to find my way to success, but not with a bit of help from the magical intellij.

EX 3. Was able to get this test figured out with some of the advice kit gave me on test 2.

EX 4. Abram walked us through this test in office hours and I was able to follow along and get this working for getTargetX() and getTargetY() wihtout issue.

EX 5. Did not have a successful
