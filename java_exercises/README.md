HOMEWORK 6
EX. 1
1. Was able to figure this out after going over java basics with Mosh, many concepts listed here but I actually bought a course with Mosh since I really liked him. His fundamentals course is what help me with exercise 1, and I then refactored this code into OOP with help from his Part 2 course which I believe can only be found in the link below. I wasn't able to COMPLETELY refactor to OOP on my own, I hopped in help and recieved help from Beth, Kit, Kuryn, and Cole to finish exercise 1. (may have been a few others too)

2. Beth walked me through this exercise in the same fashion Abram does. She lead in in the right direction by asking my questions on what I would do and how I would do it. When I was incorrect she'd let me guess then explain why. Beth was actually killer at helping me understand this and I was pretty blown away at how well she explained it.
-Mosh's advanced Java course (part 3) is what helped me grasp HashMaps and Lists, as well as some great videos on youtube I went through. I'll drop the videos but Mosh's "Collections" section in his Advanced Java course pt. 3 is what helped me get the best grasp of the concepts. However, putting the concepts together to solve the problem wasn't something I managed to do on my own.

3. Abram walked us through this exercise in office hours on a late Friday night. shoutout abram for staying till 8 on a friday night!


4. Abram walked us through this one on friday night too and I used that to help with getting started, but wasn't able to piece everything together until our group had a huddle on Sunday. Beth was able to walk me and a few other students through the exercise, (mostly Dil in this session), but in Abram fashion so we were all able to grasp the majority of concepts.
