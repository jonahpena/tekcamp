1. This udemy was rough, I learned everything from the springboot documentation / demos abigail provided.
2. Had help from Priya, Alan, Neo, Donavyn, and Beth for a few different roadblocks I encountered.
	-Beth helped with pagination
	-Priya/ Alan helped me grab the entire table from the API
	-Neo/ Donavyn helped me grab JUST the IDs rather than the entire table
