EX 1-8. Really enjoyed the udemy for this exercise. Didn't need to watch all the videos because the syntax was provided, and could reference videos when I needed help. SQL Docs and W3 we're also really helpful.

ex9. Had help from Cole to sort out mistakes in my "JOINS"

ex10. Help from Dylan (ty ty)

ex11. followed Abram and Cole along in office hours. Robin helped me finish up afterwards.
